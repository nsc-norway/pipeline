Plan for QC test directory (TODO)

 - Find an ordinary Hi X / 4000 run with paired-end and dual indexing.
 - Edit sample sheet and anonymise all projects and sample names
 - Re-demultiplex and QC.
 - Anonymise run-ID, experiment name, lot numbers.
 - Copy relevant metadata files into test directory structure Stats/ Reports/ RunInfo.xml etc etc
 - Create dummy fastq files (just replace all fq. files with gzipped 1-byte files)


Consider also testing a NSeq run
