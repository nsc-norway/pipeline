### Debugging

Troubleshooting hints: 
 - The server can be run as a stand-alone application by executing main.py with
   Python.
 - Flask debug mode is enabled by default when in development mode (TAG=="dev"), 
   but can also be enabled in production by altering the test at the top of the
   file, setting app.debug.
