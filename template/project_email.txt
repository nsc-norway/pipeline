Dear {{ "Diagnostics" if project_data.diag_project else project_data.lims.contact_person }},

Samples/Libraries submitted under {{ project_data.name }} to NSC, Ullevål has been sequenced and are now ready for pick-up. You will therefore be billed for this service.


------ Data collection ------{% if project_data.lims.delivery_method == "NeLS project" %}
The data files have been transferred to your NeLS project, and stored in the directory {{ project_data.dir }}. Please wait for a confirmation from the Elixir help desk before you access the data.
{% elif project_data.lims.delivery_method == "Norstore" %}
You can download the data and all quality control reports using the following information:

https://hts-nonsecure.web.sigma2.no/{{ project_data.dir }}/

username: {{ username }}
password: {{ password }}
{% elif project_data.lims.delivery_method == "User HDD" %}
You can pick up the data in a portable hard drive (please notice the size of the data  is approximately {{ "%.0f" % size if size else "XXXX" }} GB).
{% elif project_data.lims.delivery_method == "New HDD" %}
The data have been transferred to a new hard drive and are ready for pick-up.
{% elif project_data.lims.delivery_method == "Transfer to diagnostics" %}
Data has been transferred to /data/diag/nscDelivery folder in vali.
{% elif project_data.lims.delivery_method in ["FHI-Covid19", "MIK-Covid19"] %}
Data will be transferred as per current procedures.
{% elif project_data.lims.delivery_method == "TSD project" %}
The dataset has been imported into TSD, in a file {{ project_data.dir }}.tar.gpg.
{% else %}
You can pick up the data in a portable hard drive (please notice the size of the data  is approximately {{ "%.0f" % size if size else "XXXX" }} GB).

NOTE: UNKNOWN DELIVERY METHOD
{% endif %}

We will keep a copy of the data for THREE MONTHS after the run date, and will then DELETE ALL OUR COPIES without further notice.
{% if project_data.lims.delivery_method == "Norstore" %}The download link will stop working when we delete the data.
{% endif %}

------ Data output ------
Here is an overview of your data files and the number of fragments that were sequenced:
{% for (file, frags, rel_frags) in project_data.file_fragments_table %}
{{ "{:35}".format(file) }}{{ "\t{0:12,}".format(frags) }} fragments{% endfor %}


----- Bioinformatic analyses ----{% if project_data.lims.internal_bc_demultiplexing_16s %}
We have analysed the data using our pipeline based on QIIME 2. The tar file in your delivery contains both the raw data, demultiplexed data and the QIIME 2 analysis results. Please see the attached report file for more information.
{% else %}
Data alignment/analysis can be ordered as a service. For further details: http://www.sequencing.uio.no/services/bioinformatics/
